Notes:
Although there is more to add, the basic features I was planning on implementing when I first began the project
are all in the system now. This program can work as a functional events list calendar similar to what I have on my
Google Sheet, although a little slower to use and harder to read, so I'm happy with submitting this final prototype
to cap off this class.

Things to Add:
- Automatically load most recently loaded save
- Change add, edit, sort, etc. methods into classes
- Share method that can print or get input a string representing an event for it to load into memory
- Filtering by category
- Sub-events (threads of larger events)
- More user-friendly interfaces

Known Bugs:
- Nothing! I hope.

FIXED:
- Loading the same file twice makes that file show up twice in the "saves" Queue
- Loading a bunch of times duplicates items in the list
- Space bar counts as multiple commands at once
